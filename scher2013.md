<p> This is a Poster. It was designed by Paula Scher. It is dated 2013 and we acquired it in 2013. Its medium is digital offset lithograph on paper. It is a part of the Drawings, Prints, and Graphic Design department. </p>

<p> This poster is one of several designed by Paula Scher for the 2013 Sundance Festival, a film festival produced by the non-profit Sundance Institute. The Festival’s commitment to taking new directions in film served as Scher’s inspiration for the many arrows that make up both the graphic identity and the central theme of this poster. While the festival traditionally uses a tagline for each new season, they chose to use only a visual theme for 2013. Scher designed the hand-drawn arrows so that they could be adapted to reveal different elements—in this case, the limitless sky above Park City, Utah, where the festival takes place. </p>

<p> This object was donated by Paula Scher. It is credited "Gift of Paula Scher." </p>
