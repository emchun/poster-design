<p> This is a Poster. It is dated 2014 and we acquired it in 2017. Its medium is screenprint on paper. </p>

<p> This gallery poster showcases the hyper-elegant typography of Non-Format. Rendered in rich bronze ink, the enormous headline hovers over a striking black and white portrait. The lines of the letterforms coincide with the composition of the photograph, creating synergy between the photographic and the typographic. </p>

<p> This object was catalogued by Julie Pastor. It is credited "Gift of Non-Format." </p>
