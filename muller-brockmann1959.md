<p> This is a Poster. It was created by Josef Müller-Brockmann. It is dated 1959–60 and we acquired it in 1999. Its medium is offset lithograph on paper. It is a part of the Drawings, Prints, and Graphic Design department. </p>

<p> This poster is considered a masterpiece of modernist design. By overlapping the word “Film” with the article “der” [the], Josef Müller-Brockmann used typography to explore the principle of cinematic montage. The gray letters occupy a space behind (and a time before) the white text. </p>

<p> It is credited "Museum purchase from General Acquisitions Endowment Fund." </p>
