<p> This is a Poster. It was designed by Philippe Apeloig and made for (as the client) Cité du Livre. It is dated 2012 and we acquired it in 2014. Its medium is screenprint on paper. It is a part of the Drawings, Prints, and Graphic Design department. </p>

<p> Philippe Apeloig designed Bruits du Monde (Noises of the World) for an annual French book fair that takes place in Aix-en-Provence. For this poster, Apeloig created a font resembling strokes of charcoal or some other soft substance that appears to have been vandalized by smearing or rubbing out the type. Such a masterful typographic distortion suggests the conflict of many individual writers who are searching to express their individual voices or the millions of tears shed globally in all the books published annually. </p>

<p> This object was donated by Philippe Apeloig. It is credited "Gift of Philippe Apeloig." </p>
