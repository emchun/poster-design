<p> This is a Poster. It was designed by Mark Gowing and made for (as the client) Sherman Contemporary Art Foundation. It is dated 2008 and we acquired it in 2014. Its medium is screenprint. It is a part of the Drawings, Prints, and Graphic Design department. </p>

<p> This poster was designed to advertise a solo exhibition of the work of Jonathan Jones, a Sydney-based Aboriginal artist who is from the Kamilaroi/Wiradjuri nations located in South Eastern Australia. His work in sculpture and installation features fluorescent tubes and incandescent bulbs, often arranged in patterns that have their origins in the Kamilaroi/Wiradjuri traditions. His exhibition at Sherman Contemporary Art Foundation, “Untitled (the tyranny of distance)” showcased a piece with fluorescent lights enclosed in blue tarpaulin. For his design, Gowing adopted the colors, light and shade of Jones’ artwork and created a typeface that draws on the angular lines of the fluorescent tubes, while referencing early experiments in Soviet Constructivist typography. </p>

<p> This object was donated by Mark Gowing. It is credited "Gift of Mark Gowing." </p>
