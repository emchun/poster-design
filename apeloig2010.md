<p> This is a Poster. It is dated 2010 and we acquired it in 2013. Its medium is screenprint on coated paper. It is a part of the Drawings, Prints, and Graphic Design department. </p>

<p> This 2010 poster, designed by Philippe Apeloig, advertises the annual interdisciplinary fall festival of the French Institute Alliance Française (FIAF) in New York City. Apeloig’s design employs the same fundamental typographic approach that he used in his 2006 poster, Vivo in Typo, whereby he manipulates the spacing of computer-generated punctuation to create text forms of varying density. Apeloig riffs off of the movement implied in the title of the festival, Crossing the Line, by repeating the phrase over and over again across the poster’s surface. As the eye moves from left to right, the individual text forms appear to break apart or fade into the distance. This poster was included in the museum’s 2012 exhibition, Graphic Design: Now in Production. </p>
