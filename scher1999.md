<p> This is a Poster. It was designed by Paula Scher. It is dated 1999 and we acquired it in 2013. Its medium is screenprint on paper. It is a part of the Drawings, Prints, and Graphic Design department. </p>

<p> Inspired by her work for The Public Theater, the choreographer and dancer Eliot Feld first approached Paula Scher about designing an identity for his dance company in 1997, when he decided to rename the company Ballet Tech. Scher designed an identity using a typographic family of slab serifs, setting the typography over photographer Lois Greenfield’s images of the dancers. The following year, Scher reinvented the identity at Feld’s request, staggering the letterforms to make them appear as though they were moving in space. Feld provided Scher with different images from his company for Scher to incorporate into her designs. </p>

<p> In this poster for Ballet Tech’s 1999 season, Scher incorporates photographic images of four female dancers in identical elongated positions and sets them against a background of the lighting design plan used for the company's performances at the Joyce Theater in New York City. </p>

<p> This object was donated by Paula Scher. It is credited "Gift of Paula Scher." </p>
