<p> This is a Poster. It was designed by Michelle Leong and calligrapher: Marian Bantjes and the design director was Michael Bierut and from the office of Pentagram. It is dated 2006–07 and we acquired it in 2007. Its medium is offset lithograph on white wove paper. It is a part of the Drawings, Prints, and Graphic Design department. </p>

<p> The titling for Seduction, a poster for the Yale School of Architecture Symposium January 20–21, 2007, was commissioned by Pentagram. Marian Bantjes uses a calligraphic synthesis of Gothic and Arabic type fonts to create lettering that seems familiar yet new. The slightly sinister sensation is enhanced by the juxtaposition of thick, fleshy volumes tapering to a curling hair line. </p>

<p> A trend in contemporary design is the reexamination of the use of ornament as a counterpoint to the traditional clarity of the grid. Bantjes mines the history of calligraphy, type design, ornament, and oriental symbols and enlivens their compositions. Self-consciously autobiographical in tone, Bantjes's elaborate samplings of images, flourishes, and fonts take graphic design in a fresh new direction. </p>

<p> This object was donated by Marian Bantjes. It is credited "Gift of Marian Bantjes." </p>
