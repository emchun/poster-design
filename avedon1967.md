It was designed by Richard Avedon and published by Cowles Education Corporation and association: Maximus Enterprises, Ltd. and NEMS Enterprises, Ltd. and printed by Waterlow and Sons, Ltd. and made for Richard Avedon Posters, Inc. and Look Magazine. It is dated 1967 and we acquired it in 1981. Its medium is offset lithograph on white wove paper. It is a part of the Drawings, Prints, and Graphic Design department. </p>

<p> This poster suggests an altered state of mind by filling John Lennon’s glasses with a swirling optical illusion. The photograph has been converted to a high-contrast image, a technique sometimes called "posterization." </p>
