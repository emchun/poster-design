<p> This is a Poster. It was designed by Philippe Apeloig and published by Philippe Apeloig and printed by Serica. It is dated 2008 and we acquired it in 2013. Its medium is screenprint on coated paper. It is a part of the Drawings, Prints, and Graphic Design department. </p>
    
<p> The French designer Philippe Apeloig made this poster to promote a 2008 exhibition of his own poster designs held at the Espace Topographie de l’art in Paris. To create the typography, Apeloig produced pages of computer-generated punctuation—such as periods, hyphens, and backslashes—and manipulated them into individual text forms by varying the spacing. Using a palette of only red, white, and black, Apeloig layered these text forms in different scales so that the title of the exhibition, Vivo in Typo, emerges as if it were woven together. </p>

<p> This object was depositor: Philippe Apeloig. It is credited "Gift of Philippe Apeloig."</p>
